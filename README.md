Libraries for PDF handling

This repository contains various libraries with PDF writing functionality, along with associated libraries for handling OpenType fonts and the PDF standard fonts.  This functionality may be somewhat limited and patchy, as its features have been determined solely by the needs of other projects, but it is a from-scratch pure-.NET implementation that does not rely on other PDF writing or parsing libraries.
